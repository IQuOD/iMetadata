# iMetadata
The code here is an iPython notebook code that has been developed to allow intelligent guesses at metadata. Initially, the code is focussed on XBT data only, as there is a substantial period of data that does not have probe type information. Estimating the probe type allows better application of bias corrections.
The code is used to apply imetadata to IQuOD version 0.1, to be released in 2017.
